# Dog-Breed-Classification

It is a small project which uses transfer learning to classify the breed of the dog. The model used is MobileNetV2 from TensorFlow which provides us 84.91% accuracy. I tried two or three other models of TensorFlow but it had the most accuracy. 
The code contains the Back-end part of the project which takes image of a dog as input and displays the image and most resembling breed of that dog as output. 

Requirements : Python and all the libraries neede installed 
Steps : Download the jupyter notebook or the python code (I'll recommend using jupyter notebook as it is easier to run and originally code is written in jupyter notebook) >> Change the image path in the code to your image path. >> Run the code (In jupyter notebook, run one shell at a time for easier implementation)

The most interesting part of this project is that you can use your friend's image as input and it will tell you which dog breed he/she resembles the most !!
