# Dog-Breed-Classification
It is a small project which uses transfer learning to classify the breed of the dog. The model used is MobileNetV2 from TensorFlow which provides us 84.91% accuracy. I tried two or three other models of TensorFlow but it had the most accuracy. 
The code contains the Back-end part of the project which takes image of a dog as input and displays the image and most resembling breed of that dog as output.

## Prerequisites:
<ul>
  <li>Python</ii>
  <li>Python Libraries:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Numpy</ii>
    <li>Pandas</ii>
    <li>Matplotlib</ii>
    <li>Seaborn</ii>
    <li>Sckit-Learn</ii>
    <li>TensorFlow</li>
    <li>Keras</li>
    <li>CV2</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

## Steps: 

  <ul>
    → Download the jupyter notebook or the python code (I'll recommend using jupyter notebook as it is easier to run and originally code is written in jupyter notebook).<br>
    → Run all the shells until model is build.<br>
    → Change the image path in the code to your image path.<br>
    → Run the code (In jupyter notebook, run one shell at a time for easier implementation).<br>
  </ul>

The most interesting part of this project is that you can use your friend's image as input and it will tell you which dog breed he/she resembles the most !!
