# Dog-Breed-Classification
It is a small project which uses transfer learning to classify the breed of the dog. The model used is MobileNetV2 from TensorFlow which provides us 84.91% accuracy. I tried two or three other models of TensorFlow but it had the most accuracy. 
The code contains the Back-end part of the project which takes image of a dog as input and displays the image and most resembling breed of that dog as output. 
The most interesting part of this project is that you can use your friend's image as input and it will tell you which dog breed he/she resembles the most !!
