# Dog-Breed-Classification

It is a small project which uses transfer learning to classify the breed of the dog. The model used is MobileNetV2 from TensorFlow which provides us 84.91% accuracy. I tried two or three other models of TensorFlow but it had the most accuracy. 

The code contains the Back-end part of the project which takes image of a dog as input and displays the image and most resembling breed of that dog as output.
